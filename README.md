# Ride Booking API

A **secure**, **role-based**, and **scalable backend API** for a ride-booking system (like Uber / Pathao) built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB (Mongoose)**, and **JWT authentication**. It supports `rider`, `driver`, and `admin` roles with clear lifecycle and business rules.

## Base URL
  ```bash
  https://nirapod-ride.vercel.app/api/v1
  ```

## 🚀 Features

- JWT-based authentication with roles: `admin`, `rider`, `driver`
- Secure password hashing
- Rider functionality:
  - Request ride
  - Cancel ride (with rules)
  - View ride history
- Driver functionality:
  - Apply to become driver
  - Toggle availability (online/offline)
  - Accept / reject ride requests
  - Update ride status (`picked_up`, `in_transit`, `completed`)
  - View earnings history (derived from completed rides)
- Admin functionality:
  - Approve / reject driver applications
  - View all users and rides
  - Override ride status / cancel rides
- Full ride lifecycle tracking with timestamps
- Role-based route protection
- Validation using Zod
- Structured, modular codebase

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Roles**: 
  - `RIDER` — requests rides.
  - `DRIVER` — applies, gets approved, accepts rides, toggles availability.
  - `ADMIN` — manages users/drivers/rides.

- **Ride Status Flow**:
   requested → accepted → picked_up → in_transit → completed


- **Driver Application**:
- Rider applies → becomes `driver` role with a pending application.
- Admin approves → driver can go online and accept rides.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js / Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Zod for request validation
- bcrypt for password hashing
- TypeScript
- HTTP status codes via `http-status-codes`

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone repository**
 ```bash
 git clone <your-repo-url>
 cd <repo-directory>
```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   npm install
 ```
3. **Create a .env file**
```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>

### Notes
- Role-based access is enforced via JWT in `Authorization` header.
- Ride status transitions are validated (e.g., cannot jump from `requested` directly to `completed`).
- Drivers must be approved and online to accept rides.
- Riders can have only one active ride at a time.
